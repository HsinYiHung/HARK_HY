# This notebook uses the [Econ-ARK/HARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/hark) toolkit to describe the main results and reproduce the figures in the linked paper. The main HARK tool used here is the $\texttt{PortfolioConsumerType}$ class. For an introduction to this module, see the [HARK's Documentation](https://hark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# ### The model
# 
# In the paper the author extend the finite horizon portfolio choice model, in which consumer has uninsurable labor income risk, cannot borrow or short-sell, and has a fixed costs to hold risky assets (stocks). The extension introduces internal habit formation in preferences. The habit process is specified as a function of the household's past consumption, and both the ratio and additive specification are studied.
# 
# #### The optimization problem of ratio habit model
# \begin{equation}
# \max _{\left\{S_{i t}, B_{i t}\right\}_{t=1}^{T}} E_{1} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \beta^{t-1}\left\{\prod_{j=0}^{t-1} p_{j}\right\} U\left(C_{i t}, H_{i t}\right)
# \end{equation}
# 
# where the felicity function $U\left(C_{it},H_{it}\right)=\frac{\left\{C_{t} / H_{t}^{\gamma}\right\}^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}$. The parameter $\gamma \in [0,1]$  controls the importance of habit, and the felicity function becomes the standard time separable function with CRRA parameter equal to $\rho$ when $\gamma = 0$
# 
# 
# subject to 
# 
# \begin{array}{l}H_{i t}=(1-\lambda) H_{i t-1}+\lambda C_{i t-1} \\X_{i t+1}=S_{i t} R_{t+1}+B_{i t} R_{f}+Y_{i t+1}-F \cdot I_{P} \cdot P_{i t+1} \\X_{i t}=S_{i t}+B_{i t}+C_{i t} \\B_{i t} \geqslant 0, \quad S_{i t} \geqslant 0 \\R_{t+1}-R_{f}=\mu+\varepsilon_{t+1}, \quad \varepsilon_{t} \sim N\left(0, \sigma_{\varepsilon}^{2}\right) \\Y_{i t}=P_{i t} U_{i t}, \quad P_{i t}=\exp \left(f\left(t, Z_{i t}\right)\right) P_{i t-1} N_{i t}, \quad \text { if } t \leqslant K \\Y_{i t}=\theta P_{i K}, \quad \text { if } t>K\end{array}
# 
# #### Habit evolving process
# \begin{equation}
# H_{i t}=(1-\lambda) H_{i t-1}+\lambda C_{i t-1}
# \end{equation}
# 
# $\lambda \in [0,1]$, denotes the weight of habit formation of the consumption in the last period.
# #### Labor income process
# 
# \begin{equation}
# Y_{i t}=P_{i t} U_{i t}, \quad \text { if } t \leqslant K\\
# Y_{i t}=\theta P_{i K}, \quad \text { if } t>K
# \end{equation}
# 
# where $f(t,Z_{it})$ is a deterministic function of age and household characteristics $Z_{i,t}$. $P_{it}$ is the permanent component of income, and $U_{it}$ is a transitory part of it. The log of transitory shock, $\ln U_{it}$ is assuemed to be independend and identically distributed to $(-0.5\sigma^2_u,\sigma^2_u)$ while the log of permanent income shock $\ln N_{it} \sim (-0.5\sigma_n^2,\sigma_n^2)$
# 
# $P_{it}$ follows the following process:
# \begin{equation}
# P_{i t}=e^{\left(f\left(t, Z_{i t}\right)\right)} P_{i t-1} N_{i t}
# \end{equation}
# 
# meaning that the log of $P_{it}$ evolves as a random walk with a deterministic drift, $f(t,Z_{it})$ 
# 
# $K=46$ is assumed to be the exogenous and deterministic retiment age at 65, and $\theta\in [0,1]$ is the replacement ratio. 
# 
# #### Asset and wealth accumulation
# 
# There are two assets, one risk-free and one risky, available for consumers to allocate their savings.
# 
# - T-bills: after-tax risk-free return $R^f$.
# 
# - Stocks: $R_{t+1}-R^f = \mu + \varepsilon_{t+1}$, where $\mu$ is the mean equity premium and $\varepsilon_t \sim N(0,\sigma^2_\varepsilon)$
# 
# Denote the next period's cash on hand as $X_{i,t+1}$. When the stock market entry fee has not been paid yet, we have
# 
# \begin{equation}
# X_{i,t+1}=S_{it}R_{t+1}+B_{it}R^f+Y_{i,t+1}-FI_pP_{i,t+1}
# \end{equation}
# 
# $I_p$ is a dummy variable which takes value 1 when the cost is incurred for the first-time entrance, and takes 0 otherwise. $F$ is the fixed cost, and the total entree fee is scaled by timing the permanent income $P_{i,t+1}$
# 
# 
# ##### Intra-temporal allocation decision
# \begin{equation}
# X_{it}=C_{it}+S_{it}+B_{it}
# \end{equation}
# 
# Where $C_{it}$ denotes the consumption expenditure, $S_{it}$ denotes the amount of stock holdings, and $B_{it}$ denotes the amount of reskless asset holdings.
# 
# ##### Borrowing and short-sell constraint
# \begin{equation}
# B_{it}\geq 0\\
# S_{it}\geq 0
# \end{equation}
# 
# 
# #### Matching labor income in HARK
# 
# In HARK's consumption-saving models, the income process takes the form
# \begin{equation}
#     \ln Y_t = \ln P_t + \ln \theta_t
# \end{equation}
# where $P_t$ represents permanent income and $\ln \theta_t \sim N(0,\sigma_\theta)$ transitory shocks to income. Permanent income evolves according to
# \begin{equation}
#     \ln P_{t+1} = \ln \Gamma_{t+1} +  \ln \psi_{t+1} + \ln P_t\\
#     \ln P_{t} = \ln \Gamma_{t} +  \ln \psi_{t} + \ln P_{t-1}
# \end{equation}
# where $\Gamma_{t+1}$ is a deterministic growth factor, and $\ln \psi_{t+1} \sim N(0,\sigma_\psi)$ a permanent income shock. 
# 
# 
# To represent the author's assumptions in HARK, we express both income processes as sums of deterministic components and i.i.d shocks
# \begin{align}
# \text{GM}           &\quad& \ln Y_{i,t} &=& f(t,Z_{i,t}) + \ln P_{i,0} &+&\sum_{k=1}^t \ln N_{i,k} &+&\qquad \ln U_{i,t}\\
# \text{Cocco et. al} &\quad& \ln Y_{i,t} &=& f(t,Z_{i,t}) + v_{i,0} &+&\sum_{k=1}^t u_{i,k} &+&\qquad \varepsilon_{i,t} \\
# \text{HARK}         &\quad& \ln Y_{i,t} &=& \sum_{k=1}^t \ln \Gamma_k + \ln P_{i,0} &+&\sum_{k=1}^t \ln \psi_{i,k} &+& \qquad \ln \theta_{i,t}
# \end{align}
# 
# These representations make evident the mapping that we use
#

# 
# and to achieve a retirement income that is equal to a fraction $\lambda$ of permanent income in the last working period $K$, we simply make $\Gamma_{K+1} = \theta$ and $\Gamma_{t} = 1$ $\forall t>K+1$.
# 
# In the Appendix B the author specified that shocks are noramally distributed, and that follows the HARK assumption that we have the expected level of transitory component equals 1.

#  | Parameter | Description | Code | Value |
#  |:---:| ---         | ---  | :---: |
#  | $\beta$ | Time Preference Factor | $\texttt{DiscFac}$ | 0.95 |
#  | $\rho$ | Coefficient of Relative Risk Aversion| $\texttt{CRRA}$ | 2 |
#  | $p_t$ | Survival Probability | $\texttt{LivPrb}$ | [0.6809,0.99845] |
#  | $t_0$ | Starting Age | $\texttt{t_start}$ | 19 |
#  | $t_r$ | Retirement Age | $\texttt{t_ret}$ | 65 |

# 
# Two new parameters habit importance and habit "catch-up" speed are added and are set to 0.8 and 0.5 respectively as benchmark.
# The paper did not specify how they determine the living probability, but following the rule above, I use the 
# living probability from fotran code of Cocco et al. (2005), and add the first period living probability artificially since in Cocco et al. (2005) the agent starts to work since age 20 while in this paper the agent starts to work since age 19.

# 
# The deterministic labor income profile is chosen to reflect the hump shape of earnings over the life cycle and the parameter values are taken from Cocco et al. (1999). The retirement transfers are also calibrated using the estimation results from Cocco et al. (1999) and are set to around 68 percent of labor income in the last period of working life. These calibration values were also used in Cocco et al. (2005) and are used here.

# 
# Authors used 0.08 and 0.1 respectively for the standard deviation of log permanent shock and log transitory shock, which are consistent with the estimation by Carroll (1997).

# ## Key Results
# ### Consumption with different habit states
# The author first shows that for a given habit level, the shape of the consumption policy rule is the same as in the standard
# buffer stock saving literature. Consumption equals cash on hand below a certain threshold level, and beyond that level the marginal propensity to consume rapidly falls. The same threshold effect is also replicated below.
# To make this point clearer, we can actually write out the marginal propensity to consume with habit formation under perfect foresight to get some insight. According to [PerfForesightConsumerType.ipynb](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/blob/master/examples/ConsIndShockModel/PerfForesightConsumerType.ipynb) and [Carroll (2019)](https://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/BufferStockTheory/#MPCnvrs), we can write the recursive form of MPC as 
# \begin{align}
# \kappa_{t}^{-1} & = & 1 + \kappa_{t+1}^{-1}(\Rfree \beta)^{1/\rho}/G 
# \end{align}
# The term that times the inverse of MPC in t+1 period on the right hand side is defined in this [lecture note](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/public/LectureNotes/Consumption/PerfForesightCRRA.pdf) as "Growth Patience Factor". By some simple derivation, we can find that the GPF with habit can be written as the following:
# \begin{align}
# \frac{(\Rfree \beta)^{\frac{1}{\rho}}}{G}\left(\frac{h_{t+1}}{h_t}\right)^{\gamma(1-\frac{1}{\rho})}
# \end{align}
# showing that the habit stock is affecting the MPC of consumer, and this result is also used to construct a new HARK consumer type with under perfect foresight with habits.
# 
# Secondly, the author showed that the threshold is increasing in the stock of habits since a higher habit level requires additional consumption to maintain the same level of utility. This is also replicated below. 
# The volatile characteristics of the consumption function was not reproduced, and may require more fundamental rewrite of the coding inlucding defning new HARK consumer type.

# We can see that lower habits generate a higher level of saving than higher habit levels.

# ## Consumption with different habit importance and catch-up speed
# Authors showed in figure 2 that the consumption function with mean habit level associated with the simulations of the model decreases faster than the one without the habits. The key finding here is that the consumption with habit decreases faster, and is reproduced using the habit stock different than that used by the author. The change in habit stock actually has the same effect when altering the importance factor of habit $\gamma$, and the results is showed in figure 4 that consumption function with higher importance decreases faster, consistent with the findings in figure 2.

# ## Share of wealth in stock
# The author argued that the presence of future labor income increases the demand for stocks, but this needs to be compared to the share function without income shocks and cannot be inferred simply from figure 3.
# In addition, a higher habit importance has in fact the same effect as the high habit stocks, showing that lower habit importance generates a higher level of saving than higher habit imprtance. The result is consistent with figure 1. 
# The following replication shows the same order of share function with different habit importance, but differ with the figure in the initial range of cash-on-hand. The author's figure shows initial range of cash-on-hand for which positive savings take place for the lowest habit states, thus generating positive stock holdings, while no savings occur under the highest states.
# The replication successfully replicated that, for high levels of liquid wealth a higher habit level is associated with a higher share. Based on the inference before, a higher habit level is associated with lower saving rate, generating a smaller  ratio of savings to future labor income for a given level of cash on hand. Therefore they will invest larger proportion of their savings to risky assets.

# Here the replication shows that the share is not sensitive to habit importance since it does not affect risk attitude.

# ## Constant Habit 
# Given the paper is right that Hlambda does not affect both consumption and risky share decision, to simplify the programming, we can actually let Hlambda = 0, meaning that the habit is constant at a certain level throught the agent's whole life cycle, and get the same qualitative or even quantitative result.

# ### Simulations
# 
# Using the policy functions obtained from solving the model we present a series of simulations to highlight features of the model.
# 
# We first run a few simulations to verify the quality of our calibration.
# 
# The figures below show simulated levels of permanent income and risky portfolio shares for 50 agents over their life spans. We can see the model generates a heterogeneous permanent income distribution. Interestingly, we have the same couterfactual prediction of the
# model: households invest almost all of their wealth in stocks throughout the life-cycle (and therefore stock market participation takes place as soon as positive saving is undertaken)

# ### Other results in the original paper
# 
# #### Results with fixed participation cost
# 
# 
# #### Additive habit model
# 
# 
# ### Conclusion
# 
# The authors conclude that the inclusion of habit in the life cycle choice model does not help to explain the empirical evidence of low stock holdings in assets. With internal habit, the intertemporal consumption smoothing becomes more important and households increase their wealth accumulation. As a result, they have a stronger incentive to pay the stock market entry cost and start investing in equities very early in life. Moreover, after paying the fixed cost, they invest virtually all of their wealth in stocks. 
# ### Comparison with Cocco et al. (2005)
# This article does not provide explanation for how the optimal rsiky asset decreases with wealth, which is addressed by Cocco et al. (2005). In fact, the paper imply a counterfactual almost 100% stock market participation throught the whole life shown in the simulation.
# Both paper shown that the optimal risky asset share decreases in wealth. Both paper also agree that labor income increases risky asset holdings, as it is seen as a closer substitute of risk-free assets. 
# Another reason for the discrepancy may come form the different calibration parameters use in two papers. The following is the robustness check with several interesting parameters. 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# part worthwhile to mention that, in calibration parameters, two papers use quite different magnitude of CRRA coefficients, which are 10 in this paper and 2 in Cocco et al. (2005). The low risk aversion used in this paper's calibration may be the reason why the simulated portfolio share is quiet constant at 1 throughout the whole life. 

# #### Risk aversion
# set back the risk aversion from low (=2) to high (=10 in Cocco et al.). The replication below reproduce the similar share function as shown in CGMPortfolio.ipynb. This make sense since if the agent is not sensitive to risk, it will be optimal to put more share of wealth in the stock markets.

# #### Income distribution
# Two papers also use different distribution of permanent income. Since both paper agree that permanent income is more like the substitute to risk free asset, it is expected that the distribution of income may also affect their share in wealth.

  abstract={Motivated by the success of internal habit formation preferences in explaining asset pricing puzzles, we introduce these preferences in a life-cycle model of consumption and portfolio choice with liquidity constraints, undiversifiable labor income risk and stock-market participation costs. In contrast to the initial motivation, we find that the model is not able to simultaneously match two very important stylized facts: a low stock market participation rate, and moderate equity holdings for those households that do invest in stocks. Habit formation increases wealth accumulation because the intertemporal consumption smoothing motive is stronger. As a result, households start participating in the stock market very early in life, and invest their portfolios almost fully in stocks. Therefore, we conclude that, with respect to its ability to match the empirical evidence on asset allocation behavior, the internal habit formation model is dominated by its time-separable utility counterpart.
